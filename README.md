# QuditVis

This simple funciton will turn your statevector into a visual representation of it on the Bloch sphere, using the [Husimi-Q distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husimi_Q_representation). 
Just install the requirements and have fun playing around. You can get started in the example notebook.
